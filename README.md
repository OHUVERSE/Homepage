## 🚀 Featured Projects

### **Solana**

- **Trading Bots**  
  **DONE:** ???% **PRIO:** high  
  *For now, these will remain private.*

- **Transaction Tracker**  
  **DONE:** ~20% **PRIO:** low  
  A bot that monitors wallet addresses and sends a Telegram message for every transaction.  
  *Currently a rough JS prototype—needs a Rust rewrite. Likely to be open-sourced.*

- **Balance Tracker**  
  **DONE:** ~20% **PRIO:** low  
  Tracks holdings for given wallets over time and reports changes.  
  *Messy JS code awaiting a Rust overhaul. Probably open-source.*

- **Private Key Converter**  
  **DONE:** ~10% **PRIO:** low  
  A Windows tool to convert between array and base58 private key formats.  
  *Will be open-source (WARNING: never use a closed-source version!).  
  Born from my own struggles as a Solana newbie. I once solved this problem by transferring funds between wallets just to "convert" between key formats.*

- **More Solana tools are in the pipeline, focused on simplifying life for beginners. Updates coming soon!**

### **Other**
- **GeoSorter**  
  **DONE:** ~70% **PRIO:** low  
  Organizes photos into `country/city` folders based on geolocation data.

  **DONE:** ~40% **PRIO:** low  
  A custom solution for streamlined Discord verification and ticketing.  
  *Monetization planned—not fully open-source.*

- **Rust Error with Location**  
  **DONE:** ~80% **PRIO:** low  
  A library that leverages `panic!` location info to pinpoint errors.  
  *Ideal for Rust beginners and rapid prototyping. Just needs docs/examples before hitting crates.io.*

- **Website**  
  **DONE:** 0% **PRIO:** low  
  ohuverse.com currently redirects here.  
  *An "Amazing website" is planed to be created at some point 😄*

## 👋 About Me

I build high-frequency trading (HFT) bots and tools for Solana, plus utilities to solve everyday dev headaches. My code is all about speed and simplicity.  
After starting with JavaScript, I switched to Rust due to higher performance and stability.
